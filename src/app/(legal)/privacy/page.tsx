/**
 * The privacy policy a carrier reads before approving the campaign.
 *
 * Structured for how it is actually reviewed rather than how a policy is
 * usually written. The text-messaging section comes first and says the
 * required things in the required words: numbers are not shared, how often
 * messages arrive, and that message and data rates may apply. An earlier
 * version buried those under "what is collected" and described Twilio without
 * saying what Twilio is to us, and the campaign was rejected for a policy that
 * "could not be verified as compliant" (error 30908).
 *
 * The strings come from `lib/legal.ts`, so this cannot drift from the checkbox
 * a member actually ticks.

        {BRAND} is a private, invite-only application used by one household to
        plan meals and shop for them. It is not a public service, it sells
        nothing, and it has no advertisers. This is the only privacy policy that
        applies to {BRAND}.

        Members may optionally give a mobile number and tick a box agreeing to

        sending that member their own household&apos;s weekly grocery shopping
        list, when a member of that household asks for it to be sent. It is
        never used to market anything.
